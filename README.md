## Makarov-Mark-II
This container file was created based on the concept of a disposable pen test container. Stand-alone and basic tools are available. Imagine, if you want to do a little ethical hack on a university or junior college shared computer, or if you want to do ethical hacking or OSINT again on a computer that you don't own, the general method is to use a dedicated OS. Live booting from USB (eg Kali or Parrot) is a common practice, but most educational institutions and rental computers have BISO access restrictions. You can use the Docker engine there. Docker is almost certainly included in the laboratories and school buildings of educational institutions that constantly require advanced equipment and technology resources, and the `docker run -it --rm` command uses the pen test tool with almost no trace. can. So you don't have to install everything from scratch. 

### INSTALL

### Note: Tor
Tor sets it to use the bridge by default, but it's not up to date. This is an urgent issue and we are currently looking for an efficient bridge replacement method.
Regarding use, never use systemctl for security reasons. Again, we have not tested systemctl at all. Be sure to use the `tor &` command when using it.
